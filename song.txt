All of my life,
I asked what I have to try,
to get out of darkness, into the light.

The world is a mess.
Money it's a plague,
eats our soul
and leaves us alone.

I wanna know.
Somebody has to know,
where we do go from here

The world is a mess.
Ego it's a waste,
steals our soul
and leaves us alone.

Love, she said, love, she said,
love it's the answer but I never would see you again!
Love, she said, love, she said,
love it's the answer but you never would see me again!

Love, she said, love, she said,
love it's the answer but I never would see you again!
Love, she said, love, she said,
love it's the answer but I never would see you again!

Love it's the answer but maybe I see you again!
