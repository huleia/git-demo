All of my life,
I asked what I have to try,
to get out of darkness, into the light.

The world is a mess.
Money it's a plague,
eats our soul
and leaves us alone.

I wanna know.
Somebody has to know,
where we do go from here

The world is a mess.
Ego it's a waste,
steals our soul
and leaves us alone.
